Notes
installing the packge pip install face-recognition

Code Example avalable in jupyter-notebook "Prediction" 
the video //IMG_5926.MOV has the the face_recognition download it to see example 
the code is provided in jupyter-notebook "Video"

above are the basic programs used to show the work of the library
here is official library site more information will be provided there
https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html 

To getting started and using the models function i have uploaded a terminal and commands you can try with your own datasets 

To perform predictions 
#path 1 = the path to your known images //images that you want to be recognised
#path 2 = the path file that has images to compare to

face_recognition path1 path2        //prediction

face_recognition --show-distance true path1 path2    //getting the value  of the recognised image

face_recognition --tolerance 0.50 path1 path2      //to increase the models accuracy in facial features learned to be compared that the values lower than 0.6 will give out better output

face_recognition --cus 5  path1 path2         // increasing the processing speed of the model

You can now start to enjoy some of the amaizing feature that this model provide 
Following along to see more things that the model can do with the help of other libraries to do more things 

Example a video is uploaded that shows processing a video in real time via webcam . is available  in this repo as 'IMG_5926.MOV' an example of the model functionality 
with opencv 

More updates on related project i will post here!!
